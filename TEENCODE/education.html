                <article>
                <p>Some people in uganda believe that girls are not suposed to go to school. Cultural beliefs are forcing teenage girls out of school.
                        The cultural belief that a girl should be kept a virgin until the day she gets married such that she can be of great value also impacted on the girl child. This is because, in most cases, girl  children are withdrawn from  school for fear of losing their virginity to their peers, lustful teachers as well as men who lure them promising to marry them.
                </p>
                <p> As a direct substitute to the mother in case of sickness, absence or  death,  the girl  child has to  miss  school  or even dropout to meet the needs of the family by playing the roles that the mother plays.</p>
